# Changelog

This file is both:

1. a concise human-readable change summary, and
2. an append-only traceability ledger for agents.

## Rules

- Record every non-traceability commit that changes a canonical spec.
- Record every implementation commit tied to a canonical spec.
- Record those hashes in the immediately following traceability commit.
- Do not self-record traceability-only commits.

## Unreleased

### Summary

- Workflow documentation migrated to living canonical specs with append-only commit-hash traceability.
- Added the canonical spec, template, workflow guide, README pointers, and Pi workflow updates for feature development.
- Feature work now hard-requires the `feature-development` skill, with multi-requirement decomposition and dependency planning rules.
